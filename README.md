# interactiveForm
teamtreehouse project UNIT 03 for JS course

Project to practice my skills in JavaScript (validations, events and objects). 

In this project we will give functionality to an interactive form
and use regex and functions to validate all the user inputs throught all the form.

If validations are invalid, JS will display error messages and styles to every error detected.
Also, after first submit, form will get a new functionality, a live validator for every input.

## Skills used:
- Event Listeners
- OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
- Array manipulations
- DOM transverse

### Going for exceeds. 
The project has validations for almost every input (exclude the job section).
Also project will triger live validations on almost every input after **first submit**.
